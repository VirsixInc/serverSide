one allele is totally dominant over the other,complete dominance
phenotypes of heterozygous and homozygous dominant are indistinguishable,complete dominance
phenotype of heterozygote is intermediate between homozygous phenotypes,incomplete dominance
resulting phenotype is a blend,incomplete dominance
neither allele is completely dominant,incomplete dominance
example is red flower and white flower producing pink offspring,incomplete dominance
the two alleles both affect the phenotype in distinguishable ways,codominance
example is human blood types,codominance
both alleles for a trait are dominant and are phenotypically seen,codominance
