each DNA strand is,wrapped around,eight molecules,of histones 
histones are,globular proteins that,help determine which,part of the DNA will,be used at a determined time
by coiling around the histones,the DNA is protected when,not in use and helps,save space in the nucleoplasm
when protein synthesis,needs to occur,the helix uncoils then,coils again when done
the DNA sequence is,determined at time of conception when,sperm and ovum,unite to form a zygote
each chromosome,is composed,of many genes
genotype is,the actual genes,that an animal carries for,a particular trait 
phenotype is,the actual physical appearance,that results from the,genotype
